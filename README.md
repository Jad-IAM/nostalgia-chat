# Nostalgia Chat

Nostalgia Chat is a browser-based Matrix chat client featuring a retro, mysterious login screen and a chat interface inspired by classic Xfire. It combines modern real-time messaging with a design that pays homage to the early days of online gaming and chat.

This project leverages the Matrix protocol for decentralized, secure communication and integrates UI elements inspired by [Element](https://element.io/). Our goal is to combine the robust, open-source technology of Matrix with a uniquely nostalgic and retro user experience.
